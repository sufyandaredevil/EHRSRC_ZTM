#### About
This Repository contains notes that are taken from **CodeRed's CEHV12 Custom Bundle Learning Kit** provided by **EC-Council**.

#### Notes Nomenclature:
Notes created use the following notations that have their own meaning. Ultimately the purpose of these notes is to reduce the amount of information without compromising on concept clarity (I said notes, not a guide) but also not to digress from the core fact by not inserting PoC screenshots, long paragraphs etc for explaining a concept and prevent overlooking stuffs that are important to remember.
